Gang Garrison 2
===================
#### *A Team Fortress 2 Demake*
## Created by mrfredman, MedO, and Synnah

Two feuding, quasi-legal freelance security and espionage firms endlessly 
square off against each other in treacherous battlegrounds in an attempt to 
acquire each other's deepest secrets. A demake of a 3D game in 8-bit, 
side-scrolling style.

### Meet The Gameplay Guide

Connect to a server by opening the lobby and join a server by clicking its name. The 
lobby will show the current map, number of players, and IP of servers running. 
Alternatively, you can manually join a server if you know their IP and their
forwarded port.

There are six gameplay modes: 
- Capture the Flag
- Control Point
- Arena
- Generator
- King of the Hill
- Dual King of the Hill

Choose a team, RED or BLU, or select AutoSelect and let us choose your team for you. 
Press N to change your team, or to Spectate and watch the action! Keep in mind you 
tie up a player slot on the server as a spectator!

Press M to open the Class Menu and choose your class. Choose option 0 to let 
us pick a class that might suit you!

The Heads-Up Display on your screen shows your class, the time left in the map, 
your team, your ammunition, and your current health. All classes (except for the 
rifleman) have ammunition that replenishes over time. Certain classes will also 
have HUDs unique to them. Depending on the game mode, the HUD will display the 
locations and status of the intels (Capture the Flag), the status of the Control 
Points (Control Point), the number of players left and the status of the Arena 
Point (Arena), the health of the Generators (Generator), or the team-specific
countdown timers and the status of the KotH Point (King of the Hill).

The scoreboard shows the current score of every player. It also displays the 
name of the current server and map. 

- Capture the Flag:
Find the opposing team's intel and return it to where yours usually sits to score a point.
Score a certain number of points to win the round!

- Control Point:
  - Standard - Capture all the Control Points to win the match. 
  - Attack/Defend - RED Team must capture all the Control Points to win,
		and BLU Team must prevent RED from doing so.

- Arena:
There is no respawning in this mode, and the last team standing wins the round. If neither
team finishes the other off, then there is a control point you can capture to win the round.
Round wins are cumulative and the team with the most rounds won at the end wins the match.

- Generator:
An original mode exclusive to Gang Garrison 2. Both teams have a special generator which 
are the objectives of the map. A team must keep their generator running and destroy the 
enemy generator to win.

- King of the Hill:
There exists a lone control point in the center of the map. Both teams compete to take
control to start their countdown. First team to hold onto the point for 3 full minutes
is victorious.

- Dual King of the Hill:
An original mode exclusive to Gang Garrison 2. Teams must hold control of both control
points to run their timer down. Capturing the enemy control point will secure your own
until the enemy can take it back. First team to hold complete control for 3 minutes wins.

----------------------------------------------------------

### Meet The Maps

#### *The Official Maps:*

To run a server using only these maps, open gg2.ini and make sure no custom
map list is specified (`MapRotation=` under `[Server]` should be left blank). To change
the order the maps are played, change the numbers next to the map names; the maps
will play in numerical order from least to greatest. Place a zero next to a map to ignore it.

1. **ctf_truefort** *by fishmatt*  
This classic layout emphasizes good flagrunning and being able to evade a 
strong defense! The colorful rural scenery hides two industrial strongholds.

3. **ctf_2dfort** *by Vaati*  
A simple layout designed for fast games and tactical decisions. Don't neglect the 
lower route!

4. **ctf_conflict** *by agh*  
This battleground is filled with varied terrain and odd angles! Watch out, there are 
many places to hide and swipe the intelligence when no one will notice.

5. **ctf_classicwell** *by fishmatt*  
A nostalgic scenario with an industrial flavor, there are multiple routes around these
imposing complexes but only a few ways in and out. Keep an eye on the upper route!

6. **ctf_waterway** *by Taters*  
This trainyard sits atop a canal. The adjacent buildings house two warring factions. 
Keep your cool and watch for snipers, it's a long clear shot back to your base.

7. **ctf_orange** *by king metroid*  
Looming under the shadow of a large central tower, two groups plot each other's
demise. Climb the tower to drop down on unsuspecting opponents!

8. **cp_dirtbowl** *by Vaati*  
Somewhere in the middle of nowhere, BLU is ready to launch it's secret weapon at
RED's base within Mt. Dirtbowl. RED must push forward while BLU must hold them off
on three map fronts in this control point attack style map.

9. **cp_egypt** *by Tarzan*  
Under the blazing desert sun, RED and BLU battle to control an antiquated city.
Fight to maintain a hold on all five control points in this majestic CP map.

10. **arena_lumberyard** *by Faust*  
Somewhere in the Rocky Mountains, BLU has made an attack on an important RED 
lumberyard. You can shoot through some of the floors!

11. **arena_montane** *by Taters and agh*  
Somewhere in the forests, RED and BLU fight for supremacy over an important propaganda 
radio transmitter. Sticking with the team is best!

12. **gen_destroy** *by agh*  
In the first ever generator map for Gang Garrison, RED and BLU must destroy the others'
power generator while keeping their own running!

13. **koth_valley** *by agh*  
An abandoned spytech base conveniently concealed within a mountain range becomes a hotspot for 
waging battle. RED and BLU butt heads to take control over the technology left behind.

14. **koth_corinth** *by BassieEnAdrian and McGenio*  
An arms carrier is leaving a major port, but both RED and BLU have plans to seize the weapons.
Duke it out on the shipyard to discover who will obtain the goods.

15. **koth_harvest** *by Wherewolf*  
A community-made arena map gone official! RED and BLU fight for control of an abandoned farmyard. 
It is unknown what significance this location holds to both factions, but fear keeps invesigators 
from delving any further.

16. **dkoth_atalia** *by Wareya*  
A community-made Generator map that was converted for DKotH. It's advised to take over the central
complex to gain the advantage for when making an assault on the enemy control point.

17. **dkoth_sixties** *by Ozoh*  
A close quarters industrial map. Use the twists and turns to your advantage to eliminate the enemy
team and seize their control point.

18. **tdm_mantic** *by Wareya*  
This place is broken, but not by human hands. Kill and kill to appease the gods. If you kill
enough, they might just let you down.

19. **ctf_avanti** *by Teeferbone and Wareya*  
Your financers want intelligence on a backwater town. They say the church practiced black magic.
BLU already raided the area, but landslides blocked the road and killed half the convoy.
Can RED recover intelligence from BLU before the roads are cleared?

20. **koth_gallery** *by Heenok*  
This famous art gallery will open its doors for a new exhibition tomorrow. The center piece?
A statue of pure canadium. Go in and grab it tonight! Deal with any other team of mercenaries
who may want it, too. However, I still want to enjoy the exhibition, so try not to smash too
many priceless pieces, will you?

21. **ctf_eiger** *by kildau*  
Located in the cold and harsh Alps, this map emphasizes on teamwork and good co-operation.
Taking control of the central area will make your team's chances of winning several times higher.
Beware of scouts, spies and explosive classes using alternate routes and hard-to-reach places.

#### *Using Custom Maps:*

To run a server using custom maps, make a folder called "Maps" in the same 
path as Gang Garrison 2.exe and place the compiled map file (it will have 
a ".png" extension) inside. Create a text file with any name, like "maplist.txt", and 
open gg2.ini. Next to `MapRotation=` under `[Server]`, type the name of this file.

Open your maplist file and type the name of each map you want to play in order:
For instance:

    ctf_2dfort
    ctf_mynewmap
    ctf_orange

would play ctf_2dfort, a custom map with the filename `ctf_mynewmap.png`, and 
then ctf_orange. Then it would play ctf_2dfort again. These names are case sensitive.

----------------------------------------------------------

### Meet The Options Menu:

These options can also be set in gg2.ini before running the game. You can also
bring up the menu by pressing 'ESC' in-game.

- *Hosting Port:* Set the TCP port clients will connect to if you host a game.

	windowed.
- *Ingame Music:* Toggles the ingame music track on and off.
- *Particles:* Toggles smoke and explosion effects. Turning this off or using the
	alternative particles may reduce graphical lag.
- *Gibs:* Toggles body parts when a character explodes. Turning this setting down may
	reduce graphical lag.

- *Show Healing:* Toggles healing HUDs for the Healer and players who are being healed.

----------------------------------------------------------
### Meet The Gameplay Tips

**Runner:**
- Use paths that no other class can use!
- Your scattergun does a surprising amount of damage!
- Keep some ammo saved up in case you need to fight an infiltrator!

**Firebug:**
- Use your airblast to push your enemies around!
- Extinguish your teammates with the airblast if they're on fire!
- Set a foe on fire and let the afterburn take care of the rest!

**Rocketman:**
- Your rockets can go through teammates!
- Rocketjump up to high platforms or to rain rockets from above!
- Rockets can destroy the detonator's mines with an explosion!

**Overweight:**
- Eat a manvich when it's safe, not when there are enemies around!
- Don't eat a manvich if a healer is waiting to heal you!
- Remember to retreat if you're taking too much damage!

**Detonator:**
- You can detonate your mines in the air; they don't have to 'stick'
  to a surface to detonate!
- Your mines deal a maximum of 45 damage each to players, and 50 to
  buildings.
- Sticky mines can destroy other detonator's mines with an explosion!
- Shoot a sticky and detonate it at the same time while pointing down
  to propel yourself like a Rocketman!

**Healer:**
- You slowly regenerate your health! Dodge well to maximize it!
- Use your medigun to rapidly heal off afterburn!
- Use your superburst to get past tight chokepoints!

**Constructor:**
- You regenerate Nuts and Bolts slowly, but picking up metal from a
  destroyed autogun instantly gives you 50! Health cabinets also give
  you all your Nuts and Bolts back!
- Autoguns can't shoot straight up, so watch out!
- Your autogun will default to the direction you aim when you build
  it, so be careful!

**Infiltrator:**
- The enemy can still hear you jump even if you are cloaked!
- Your revolver is a lot stronger than it looks! It has a lot of
  range too!
- Passive invisibility is always useful!

**Rifleman:**
- Stay moving in case an infiltrator is eyeing your back!
- Your scope inhibits movement. Scope out if you need to move around!
- Pick off enemies at a distance with charged shots, or "railgun"
  them at close range without scoping for direct combat!

**Secret Class:**
- There is no secret class, and you can 'QQ' about it.
